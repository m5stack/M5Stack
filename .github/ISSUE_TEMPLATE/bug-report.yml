      To improve the speed of resolution please review the following guidelines and common troubleshooting steps below before creating the issue:\n\
      Do not use GitHub issues for troubleshooting projects and issues. Instead use the forums at https://community.m5stack.com to ask questions and troubleshoot why something isn't working as expected.  In many cases the problem is a common issue that you will more quickly receive help from the forum community.  GitHub issues are meant for known defects in the code.  If you don't know if there is a defect in the code then start with troubleshooting on the forum first."
